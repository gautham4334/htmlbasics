        <p><b>Rohit</b> Sharma and Virat <b>Kohli</b> starred with the bat as India chased down the 287-run target against Australia
            in the third ODI at <i>M Chinnaswamy Stadium</i> in Bengaluru to clinch the three-match series 2-1 on Sunday. Rohit
            Sharma scored his 29th ODI hundred while skipper Virat Kohli scored his 57th fifty of his ODI career. Rohit
            and Kohli added 137 runs for the second wicket, helping India take control of the game. Rohit got out for
            119 runs while Kohli smashed 89 runs. Shreyas Iyer scored a quickfire 44 off 35 balls to help India chase
            down the total with 15 balls left and register a seven wicket win. For Australia, Pat Cummmins and Mitchell
            Starc had an off day as they leaked boundaries way too often. Both of the them went wicket-less. Ashton
            Agar, Adam Zampa and Josh Hazlewood bowled economically and picked up a wicket each but couldn't help their
            side get across the finish line. Earlier, Australia skipper Aaron Finch won the toss and opted to bat. Steve
            Smith (131 runs off 132 balls) scored his 9th ODI hundred, while Marnus Labuschagne smashed his maiden ODI
            fifty, helping Australia score 286/9 in Bengaluru.</p>
